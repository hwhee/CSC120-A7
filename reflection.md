- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    I think it makes a lot of sense at this point. I anticipate that as we work more with it it may become more challenging to understand, but I think I'm getting a good foundational grasp on it.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    This assignment was pretty straightforward for me, but when I did run into points where I would get stuck, it was really helpful to take a break for maybe 10 minutes and come back with a more refreshed perspective, because what wasn't working was working continuously for hours with no breaks. That would make it so my brain wasn't really processing bigger picture things and focussing too much on details. So I would say, as advice, that people should remember to take breaks and try doing the assignments in segments, if it doesn't mess with their flow too much.
